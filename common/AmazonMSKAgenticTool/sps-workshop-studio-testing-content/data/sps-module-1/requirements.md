# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python Streamlit application that provides an intuitive interface for uploading log files and analyzing them using Amazon Bedrock's Nova Pro model. The application will automatically analyze uploaded logs for issues and provide either solutions for identified problems or a summary of the current log state when no issues are detected. Additionally, it includes an AI chat interface for users to ask follow-up questions about their logs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to upload log files through a simple web interface, so that I can quickly analyze them without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a file upload widget
2. WHEN a user selects a log file THEN the system SHALL accept common log file formats (txt, log, csv)
3. WHEN a file is uploaded successfully THEN the system SHALL display confirmation of the upload
4. IF the uploaded file is not a supported format THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic log analysis upon upload, so that I can immediately understand if there are any critical issues requiring attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a log file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically send the log content to Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro model
2. WHEN Bedrock analysis detects issues THEN the system SHALL display identified problems with suggested solutions
3. WHEN Bedrock analysis finds no issues THEN the system SHALL display a summary of the current log state
4. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
5. IF the Bedrock API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ask follow-up questions about my logs through a chat interface, so that I can get deeper insights and clarification about specific log entries or patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are uploaded and analyzed THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface
2. WHEN a user types a question in the chat THEN the system SHALL send the question along with log context to Bedrock
3. WHEN Bedrock responds to a chat question THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat window
4. WHEN multiple questions are asked THEN the system SHALL maintain chat history within the session
5. IF a chat request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the chat

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a clean and functional interface, so that I can focus on log analysis without distractions from complex UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a minimalistic interface with clear sections
2. WHEN components are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and layout
3. WHEN the interface is viewed THEN the system SHALL be responsive and functional
4. WHEN users interact with elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper AWS credentials configuration, so that the application can securely connect to Amazon Bedrock services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL attempt to authenticate with AWS using configured credentials
2. IF AWS credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions for setup
3. WHEN Bedrock API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and error handling
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with guidance
