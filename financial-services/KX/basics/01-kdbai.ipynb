      "- It set forth admirable goals like equality before the law, freedom of speech and religion, due process, and the consent of the governed for taxation. However, fully realizing these rights took time and struggle.\n",

      "- The declaration was more of a statement of philosophy rather than a detailed legal code that could be easily enforced across France.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Certain rights like property rights (Article 17) came into conflict with the more radical factions during the French Revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "- While influential, the declaration initially lacked solid constitutional mechanisms to ensure its principles were upheld by the revolutionary governments that followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The rights laid out applied to \"men\" and \"citizens\" but not explicitly to women or minorities at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, while an inspirational document that promoted Enlightenment ideals of individual liberty, the full and practical implementation of the 1789 declaration's articles proved difficult in the short-term in very turbulent revolutionary times. It took decades and centuries of activism and reform to more fully enshrine these rights into the legal and social fabric of France.\n",
