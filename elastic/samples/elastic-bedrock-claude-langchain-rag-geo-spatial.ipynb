    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show you how to use Elastic search, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude 3 and Langchain to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that leverages Geospatial features of Elastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use case\n",
    "This notebook introduces an interactive AI agent designed to assist with real estate inquiries. Users looking to purchase properties, such as townhomes, condos, or single-family homes, in specific locations (e.g., New York, NY or Cupertino, CA) can use the agent to find listings that match their preferences. These preferences can include factors like city, distance, property type, and desired amenities such as a swimming pool or lawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to build a geospatial RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Elastic's geospatial search capabilities in combination with LLMs from the Amazon Bedrock platform. The tools we'll use include Elasticsearch, the Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet Foundation model, Amazon Bedrock, and Langchain. Additionally, we'll integrate Amazon Location Service for geocoding physical addresses and Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to send property listing recommendations to users.\n"

    "## Amazon Location Services for Geocoding\n",
    "Here we will leverage Amazon location services for geocoding. \n",
    "Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), which can be used to place markers on a map or identify locations in spatial data. It helps map a physical location, such as \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, D.C.,\" into its corresponding geographic coordinates, enabling applications like GPS navigation, location-based services, or geographic information systems (GIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are we geocoding?\n",
    "The purpose of geocoding is to convert the extracted geographical location from the user prompt in to longitude and latitude, so that these coordinates can be used to search for real estate properties data in Elastic."
