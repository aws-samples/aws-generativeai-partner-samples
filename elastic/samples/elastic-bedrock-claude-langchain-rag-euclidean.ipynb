    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show you how to use Elastic search, Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic Claude 3 and Langchain to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution with Euclidean distance retrieval algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the RAG capability with Euclidean distance retrieval algorithm, let's take the use case of an AI Assistant that can help answer questions from a personal document. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "You are Bob,an Application Developer at Anycompany. Anycompany is experiencing an overwhelming number of customer queries. Anycompany has built a secure and performant conversational AI Assistant to answer frequently asked questions. Now Anycompany wants this conversational AI assistant to be able to answer questions are which are specific to the company and also wants to with Euclidean distance retrieval algorithm for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will build a context aware conversational AI Assistant for Anycompany \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "To fulfill this use case, in this notebook we will show how to create a RAG Application with Euclidean distance retrieval algorithm to answer questions from business data. We will use  Elasticsearch, Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet Foundation model, Amazon Bedrock and Langchain. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "We're using an Elastic Cloud deployment of Elasticsearch for this notebook. If you don't have an Elastic Cloud deployment, sign up [here](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration) for a free trial."
