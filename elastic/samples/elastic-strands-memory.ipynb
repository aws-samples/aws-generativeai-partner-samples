    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Successfully integrated `elasticsearch_memory` as a tool in a Strands agent\n",
    "- **Persistent Memory**: Demonstrated how agents can maintain memory across different sessions\n",
    "- **Personalization**: Showed how memory enables personalized and contextual responses\n",
    "- **Security**: Used secure credential handling with getpass instead of hardcoding\n",
    "- **Practical Applications**: Explored real-world use cases for memory-enabled agents\n",
    "- **Direct Tool Usage**: Learned how to use the tool directly when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different namespaces to create separate memory contexts\n",
    "- Try using multiple memory tools for different types of information\n",
    "- Explore memory search and filtering capabilities\n",
    "- Integrate with other Strands tools for more complex workflows\n",
    "- Consider memory cleanup and management strategies for production use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Elasticsearch Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Elasticsearch provides robust storage for large amounts of memory data\n",
    "- **Search Capabilities**: Advanced search and filtering of stored memories using semantic similarity\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Memories survive across agent restarts and deployments\n",
    "- **Performance**: Fast retrieval of relevant context for agent responses\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Support for both Elasticsearch Cloud and serverless deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Uses Amazon Bedrock Titan models for semantic search\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Implements k-NN search with cosine similarity\n",
    "- **Namespace Isolation**: Supports multi-tenant applications\n",
    "- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for create, read, update, delete operations\n",
