    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to leverage semantic chunking to enhance the performance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution built using Langchain, Anthropic Claude 3.7, Elastic, RAGAS,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving the relevance and coherence of retrieved contexts in a RAG application through semantic chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analyst at Anycompany, Alice wants to improve the quality of the responses generated by the RAG solution. She has noticed that sometimes the retrieved contexts may lack coherence or contain irrelevant information, leading to suboptimal responses. Alice is seeking a technique to organize and filter the retrieved contexts more effectively, ensuring that only the most relevant and semantically related information is utilized for generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this use case, we will incorporate semantic chunking into the RAG application. Semantic chunking is a process that groups related sentences or text units together based on their semantic meanings or relatedness, rather than simply splitting the text based on size or separators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of semantic chunking in this RAG solution involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentence Splitting**: The first step is to divide the text corpus into individual sentences, as sentences are considered the basic units of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentence Pairing**: Neighboring sentences are paired together to capture the relationships between sequential sentences. This pairing involves a buffer size, which determines the number of preceding and leading sentences to combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation**: The paired sentences are then converted into numerical representations called embeddings, which capture the underlying semantic meanings of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Similarity Calculation**: The cosine similarity between the embeddings of paired sentences is calculated to measure their semantic relatedness or distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization and Thresholding**: The cosine distances between sequential sentence embeddings are visualized to identify breakpoints or boundaries for creating semantic chunks. A threshold value, often determined using a percentile-based approach, is used to group sentences into semantic chunks based on their cosine distance or similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating semantic chunking into the RAG solution, which utilizes the Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet Foundation model, Elastic, Langchain and RAGAS, Alice can ensure that the retrieved contexts are semantically cohesive and highly relevant to the input question or query. This approach improves the overall quality and coherence of the responses generated by the RAG application."

    "## Semantic Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking is a process of dividing text into meaningful chunks or segments based on the semantic similarity or relatedness of sentences/text units, rather than simply splitting text based on size or separators. The key aspects of semantic chunking are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Splitting the text into individual sentences as basic units.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pairing neighboring sentences together to capture relationships between sequential sentences. The pairing involves a buffer size (e.g., 1 preceding and 1 leading sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Converting the paired sentences into numerical embeddings, which capture the underlying semantic meanings of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculating the cosine similarity between the embeddings of paired sentences to measure their semantic relatedness or distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualizing the cosine distances between sequential sentence embeddings to identify breakpoints or boundaries for creating semantic chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Determining a threshold value (e.g., a percentile value like 95th percentile) to group sentences into semantic chunks based on their cosine distance/similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of semantic chunking is that it groups related sentences or text units together based on their semantic meanings, rather than chunking text without understanding the context or relatedness. This approach ensures that the resulting chunks contain semantically cohesive and related content, which can be beneficial for various NLP tasks, such as information extraction, summarization, or question answering."

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans. Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. Six days ago, Russia\\x92s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament \\x93Light will win over darkness.\\x94 The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. Throughout our history we\\x92ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving.'),\n",

He thought the West and NATO wouldn\\x92t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.'),\n",

And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. Together with our allies \\x96we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We are cutting off Russia\\x92s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia\\x92s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin\\x92s $630 Billion \\x93war fund\\x94 worthless. We are choking off Russia\\x92s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come. Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights \\x96 further isolating Russia \\x96 and adding an additional squeeze \\x96on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia\\x92s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering. Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies \\x96 in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. For that purpose we\\x92ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield \\x96 he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards. To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\\x92ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. And I\\x92m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\\x92s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. I understand. I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. That\\x92s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan. Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans. Helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. And as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people\\x97and left no one behind. And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. In fact\\x97our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn\\x92t worked for the working people of this nation for too long. For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. Invest in America.'),\n",

We won\\x92t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don\\x92t fix that. That\\x92s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\\x97the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We\\x92re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We\\x92re going to have an infrastructure decade. It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world\\x97particularly with China. As I\\x92ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. We\\x92ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. And we\\x92ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. We\\x92ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes\\x97so every child\\x97and every American\\x97has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American\\x97urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. 4,000 projects have already been announced.

When we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America \\x96 we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. The federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. There\\x92s been a law on the books for almost a century \\nto make sure taxpayers\\x92 dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every Administration says they\\x92ll do it, but we are actually doing it. We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. But to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That\\x92s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.

And while we\\x92re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let\\x92s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. Second \\x96 cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change. Let\\x92s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America\\x92s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you\\x92ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. Third \\x96 cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. Middle-class and working families shouldn\\x92t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children. My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\\x92t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. My plan doesn\\x92t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old. All of these will lower costs. And under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody. The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it. I\\x92m not looking to punish anyone. But let\\x92s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax. That\\x92s simply not fair. That\\x92s why I\\x92ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can\\x92t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.

When corporations don\\x92t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.

Tonight, I\\x92m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. We\\x92ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.

For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. And I know you\\x92re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. But I also know this. Because of the progress we\\x92ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. We\\x92ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July. Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\x97the CDC\\x97issued new mask guidelines. Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free. And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives. I know some are talking about \\x93living with COVID-19\\x94. Tonight \\x96 I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely. First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you\\x92re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. The scientists are working hard to get that done and we\\x92ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. We\\x92re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%. We\\x92ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month. And we\\x92re launching the \\x93Test to Treat\\x94 initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they\\x92re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost. If you\\x92re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. We\\x92re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\\x92s needs as we move forward. And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free. Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. Second \\x96 we must prepare for new variants.'),\n",

That\\x92s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. That\\x92s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\\x97trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope. We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\\x97they have no serial numbers and can\\x92t be traced. And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\\x92t be sued. These laws don\\x92t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote \\x96 and to have it counted. And it\\x92s under assault. In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. We cannot let this happen. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\\x92re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, I\\x92d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\\x97an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\\x92s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\\x92s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\\x92s been nominated, she\\x92s received a broad range of support\\x97from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we\\x92ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. We\\x92ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We\\x92re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. We\\x92re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land\\x97my forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don\\x92t wait decades to reunite. It\\x92s not only the right thing to do\\x97it\\x92s the economically smart thing to do. That\\x92s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.'),\n",

Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade\\x97standing precedent for half a century\\x97is under attack as never before. If we want to go forward\\x97not backward\\x97we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman\\x92s right to choose. And let\\x92s continue to advance maternal health care in America. And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\\x92s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\\x92t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, we\\x92ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. So tonight I\\x92m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together. First, beat the opioid epidemic. There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery. Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. If you\\x92re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. Second, let\\x92s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down. The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part\\x97sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\\x92re conducting on our children for profit. It\\x92s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. And let\\x92s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. Third, support our veterans. Veterans are the best of us. I\\x92ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free. Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from \\x93burn pits\\x94 that incinerated wastes of war\\x97medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. When they came home, many of the world\\x92s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. Headaches.'),\n",

Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.

And fourth, let\\x92s end cancer as we know it. This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America\\x96second only to heart disease. Last month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. More support for patients and families. To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. It\\x92s based on DARPA\\x97the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.

And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. Six days ago, Russia\\x92s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

That\\x92s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. Putin\\x92s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn\\x92t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did. We prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression. We countered Russia\\x92s lies with truth. And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. Together with our allies \\x96we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We are cutting off Russia\\x92s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia\\x92s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin\\x92s $630 Billion \\x93war fund\\x94 worthless. We are choking off Russia\\x92s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come. Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights \\x96 further isolating Russia \\x96 and adding an additional squeeze \\x96on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia\\x92s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering. Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies \\x96 in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. For that purpose we\\x92ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield \\x96 he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards. To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\\x92ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies. These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\\x92s happening can seem alarming.'),\n",

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. I understand. I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. That\\x92s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan. Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans. Helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. And as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people\\x97and left no one behind. And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. In fact\\x97our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn\\x92t worked for the working people of this nation for too long. For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. Invest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \\nand the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won\\x92t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don\\x92t fix that. That\\x92s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\\x97the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We\\x92re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We\\x92re going to have an infrastructure decade. It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world\\x97particularly with China. As I\\x92ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. We\\x92ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. And we\\x92ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. We\\x92ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes\\x97so every child\\x97and every American\\x97has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American\\x97urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. 4,000 projects have already been announced. And tonight, I\\x92m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. When we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America \\x96 we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. The federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. There\\x92s been a law on the books for almost a century \\nto make sure taxpayers\\x92 dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every Administration says they\\x92ll do it, but we are actually doing it. We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. But to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That\\x92s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. Let me give you one example of why it\\x92s so important to pass it. If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you\\x92ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. It won\\x92t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you\\x92ll see a \\x93Field of dreams,\\x94 the ground on which America\\x92s future will be built. This is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor \\x93mega site\\x94. Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. Smartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. But that\\x92s just the beginning. Intel\\x92s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. That would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. And all they\\x92re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. So let\\x92s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I\\x92ll sign it. And we will really take off. And Intel is not alone. There\\x92s something happening in America. Just look around and you\\x92ll see an amazing story. The rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products \\x93Made In America.\\x94 The revitalization of American manufacturing. Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. That\\x92s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history\\x97$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. All told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. Powered by people I\\x92ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who\\x92s here with us tonight. As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, \\x93It\\x92s time to bury the label \\x93Rust Belt.\\x94 \\n\\nIt\\x92s time. But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. I get it. That\\x92s why my top priority is getting prices under control. Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. The pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. When factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. Look at cars. Last year, there weren\\x92t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. And guess what, prices of automobiles went up. So\\x97we have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation. Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let\\x92s make it in America. Economists call it \\x93increasing the productive capacity of our economy.\\x94 \\n\\nI call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. 17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here\\x92s the plan: \\n\\nFirst \\x96 cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis. He and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua\\x92s mom. Imagine what it\\x92s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you\\x92re going to pay for it. What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. Joshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy. For Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\\x92s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. Drug companies will still do very well. And while we\\x92re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let\\x92s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. Second \\x96 cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change. Let\\x92s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America\\x92s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you\\x92ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. Third \\x96 cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. Middle-class and working families shouldn\\x92t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children. My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\\x92t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. My plan doesn\\x92t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old. All of these will lower costs. And under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody. The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it. I\\x92m not looking to punish anyone. But let\\x92s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax. That\\x92s simply not fair. That\\x92s why I\\x92ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations. We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can\\x92t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. That\\x92s why I\\x92ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don\\x92t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter. So that\\x92s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. So what are we waiting for? Let\\x92s get this done. And while you\\x92re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation. My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. We\\x92re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans. And tonight, I\\x92m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office. The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. I\\x92m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn\\x92t capitalism. It\\x92s exploitation\\x97and it drives up prices. When corporations don\\x92t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. Tonight, I\\x92m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. We\\x92ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. Let\\x92s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Let\\x92s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill\\x97our First Lady who teaches full-time\\x97calls America\\x92s best-kept secret: community colleges. And let\\x92s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union\\x97they shouldn\\x92t be stopped. When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven\\x92t done in a long time: build a better America. For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. And I know you\\x92re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. But I also know this. Because of the progress we\\x92ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. We\\x92ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July. Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\x97the CDC\\x97issued new mask guidelines. Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free. And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives. I know some are talking about \\x93living with COVID-19\\x94. Tonight \\x96 I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely. First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you\\x92re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. The scientists are working hard to get that done and we\\x92ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. We\\x92re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%. We\\x92ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month. And we\\x92re launching the \\x93Test to Treat\\x94 initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they\\x92re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost. If you\\x92re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. We\\x92re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\\x92s needs as we move forward. And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free. Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. Second \\x96 we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we\\x92ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we\\x92ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years. And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we\\x92ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. I cannot promise a new variant won\\x92t come. But I can promise you we\\x92ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does. Third \\x96 we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. It\\x92s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office. We\\x92re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. Our schools are open. Let\\x92s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. Of course, continuing this costs money. I will soon send Congress a request. The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly. Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world. We\\x92ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. And we won\\x92t stop. We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. Let\\x92s use this moment to reset. Let\\x92s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Let\\x92s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans. We can\\x92t change how divided we\\x92ve been. But we can change how we move forward\\x97on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans who\\x92d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. I\\x92ve worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\\x92ll walk the beat, who\\x92ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. So let\\x92s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Let\\x92s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. That\\x92s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. That\\x92s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\\x97trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope. We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\\x97they have no serial numbers and can\\x92t be traced. And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\\x92t be sued. These laws don\\x92t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote \\x96 and to have it counted. And it\\x92s under assault. In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. We cannot let this happen. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\\x92re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, I\\x92d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\\x97an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\\x92s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\\x92s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\\x92s been nominated, she\\x92s received a broad range of support\\x97from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we\\x92ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. We\\x92ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We\\x92re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. We\\x92re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land\\x97my forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don\\x92t wait decades to reunite. It\\x92s not only the right thing to do\\x97it\\x92s the economically smart thing to do. That\\x92s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let\\x92s get it done once and for all. Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade\\x97standing precedent for half a century\\x97is under attack as never before. If we want to go forward\\x97not backward\\x97we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman\\x92s right to choose. And let\\x92s continue to advance maternal health care in America. And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\\x92s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\\x92t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, we\\x92ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. So tonight I\\x92m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together. First, beat the opioid epidemic. There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery. Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. If you\\x92re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. Second, let\\x92s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down. The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part\\x97sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\\x92re conducting on our children for profit. It\\x92s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. And let\\x92s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. Third, support our veterans. Veterans are the best of us. I\\x92ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free. Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from \\x93burn pits\\x94 that incinerated wastes of war\\x97medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. When they came home, many of the world\\x92s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. Headaches.'),\n",

A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know. One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. We don\\x92t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. But I\\x92m committed to finding out everything we can. Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. Heath\\x92s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath\\x92s lungs and body. Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. He didn\\x92t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. Tonight, Danielle\\x97we are. The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. And tonight, I\\x92m announcing we\\x92re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. I\\x92m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. And fourth, let\\x92s end cancer as we know it. This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America\\x96second only to heart disease. Last month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. More support for patients and families. To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. It\\x92s based on DARPA\\x97the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more. ARPA-H will have a singular purpose\\x97to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\\x92s, diabetes, and more. A unity agenda for the nation.'),\n",

My fellow Americans\\x97tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\\x97the citadel of our democracy. In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.

Our moment of responsibility. Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. Well I know this nation. We will meet the test. To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. We will save democracy. As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. Because I see the future that is within our grasp. Because I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.

Six days ago, Russia\\x92s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament \\x93Light will win over darkness.\\x94 The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. Together with our allies \\x96we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We are cutting off Russia\\x92s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia\\x92s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin\\x92s $630 Billion \\x93war fund\\x94 worthless. We are choking off Russia\\x92s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come. Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights \\x96 further isolating Russia \\x96 and adding an additional squeeze \\x96on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia\\x92s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering. Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies \\x96 in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. For that purpose we\\x92ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield \\x96 he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards. To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\\x92ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. And I\\x92m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\\x92s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. I understand. I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. That\\x92s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan. Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans. Helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. And as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people\\x97and left no one behind. And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. In fact\\x97our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn\\x92t worked for the working people of this nation for too long. For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. Invest in America.'),\n",

We\\x92ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.

That\\x92s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.

Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let\\x92s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. Second \\x96 cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change. Let\\x92s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America\\x92s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you\\x92ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. Third \\x96 cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. Middle-class and working families shouldn\\x92t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children. My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\\x92t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. My plan doesn\\x92t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old. All of these will lower costs.

When corporations don\\x92t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.

Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.

For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. And I know you\\x92re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. But I also know this. Because of the progress we\\x92ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. We\\x92ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July. Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\x97the CDC\\x97issued new mask guidelines. Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free. And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives. I know some are talking about \\x93living with COVID-19\\x94. Tonight \\x96 I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely. First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you\\x92re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. The scientists are working hard to get that done and we\\x92ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. We\\x92re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%. We\\x92ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month. And we\\x92re launching the \\x93Test to Treat\\x94 initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they\\x92re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost. If you\\x92re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. We\\x92re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\\x92s needs as we move forward. And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free. Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. Second \\x96 we must prepare for new variants.'),\n",

But I can promise you we\\x92ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does. Third \\x96 we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. It\\x92s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office. We\\x92re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. Our schools are open. Let\\x92s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.

Let\\x92s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Let\\x92s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans. We can\\x92t change how divided we\\x92ve been. But we can change how we move forward\\x97on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans who\\x92d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. I\\x92ve worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who\\x92ll walk the beat, who\\x92ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. So let\\x92s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Let\\x92s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. That\\x92s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. That\\x92s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption\\x97trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope. We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home\\x97they have no serial numbers and can\\x92t be traced. And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\\x92t be sued. These laws don\\x92t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote \\x96 and to have it counted. And it\\x92s under assault. In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. We cannot let this happen. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\\x92re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, I\\x92d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\\x97an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\\x92s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\\x92s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\\x92s been nominated, she\\x92s received a broad range of support\\x97from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we\\x92ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. We\\x92ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. We\\x92re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. We\\x92re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land\\x97my forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don\\x92t wait decades to reunite. It\\x92s not only the right thing to do\\x97it\\x92s the economically smart thing to do. That\\x92s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.'),\n",

Preserve a woman\\x92s right to choose. And let\\x92s continue to advance maternal health care in America. And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\\x92s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\\x92t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, we\\x92ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. So tonight I\\x92m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together. First, beat the opioid epidemic. There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery. Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. If you\\x92re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. Second, let\\x92s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down. The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part\\x97sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\\x92re conducting on our children for profit. It\\x92s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. And let\\x92s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. Third, support our veterans. Veterans are the best of us. I\\x92ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free. Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from \\x93burn pits\\x94 that incinerated wastes of war\\x97medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. When they came home, many of the world\\x92s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. Headaches.'),\n",

    "## Evaluating the RAG application\n",
    "\n",
    "First, import all the metrics you want to use from `ragas.metrics`. Then, you can use the `evaluate()` function and simply pass in the relevant metrics and the prepared dataset. Below is a brief description of the metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Faithfulness**: This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "* **Response Relevance**: The evaluation metric, Response Relevancy, focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information and higher scores indicate better relevancy. This metric is computed using the question, the context and the answer. Please note, that eventhough in practice the score will range between 0 and 1 most of the time, this is not mathematically guaranteed, due to the nature of the cosine similarity ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "* **Context Precision**: Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question, ground_truth and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "* **Context Recall**: Context recall measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. It is computed based on the ground truth and the retrieved context, and the values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "* **Context entities recall**: This metric gives the measure of recall of the retrieved context, based on the number of entities present in both ground_truths and contexts relative to the number of entities present in the ground_truths alone. Simply put, it is a measure of what fraction of entities are recalled from ground_truths. This metric is useful in fact-based use cases like tourism help desk, historical QA, etc. This metric can help evaluate the retrieval mechanism for entities, based on comparison with entities present in ground_truths, because in cases where entities matter, we need the contexts which cover them.\n",
    "* **Answer Semantic Similarity**: The concept of Answer Semantic Similarity pertains to the assessment of the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer, with values falling within the range of 0 to 1. A higher score signifies a better alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "* **Answer Correctness**: The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness. Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity. These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score. Users also have the option to employ a ‘threshold’ value to round the resulting score to binary, if desired.\n",
    "* **Aspect Critique**: This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness, maliciousness, coherence, and conciseness. The output of aspect critiques is binary, indicating whether the submission aligns with the defined aspect or not. This evaluation is performed using the ‘answer’ as input."

       "      <td>[Lets use this moment to reset. Lets stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Lets stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans. We cant change how divided weve been. But we can change how we move forwardon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans whod grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. Ive worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers wholl walk the beat, wholl know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. So lets not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Lets come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. Thats why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. Thats why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruptiontrusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope. We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at homethey have no serial numbers and cant be traced. And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that cant be sued. These laws dont infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote  and to have it counted. And its under assault. In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. We cannot let this happen. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while youre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, Id like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nations top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyers legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since shes been nominated, shes received a broad range of supportfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, weve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. Weve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. Were putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. Were securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this landmy forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families dont wait decades to reunite. Its not only the right thing to doits the economically smart thing to do. Thats why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce., The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. Im a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isnt capitalism. Its exploitationand it drives up prices. When corporations dont have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. Tonight, Im announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. Well also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. Lets pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Lets increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jillour First Lady who teaches full-timecalls Americas best-kept secret: community colleges. And lets pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a unionthey shouldnt be stopped. When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we havent done in a long time: build a better America. For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. And I know youre tired, frustrated, and exhausted. But I also know this. Because of the progress weve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. Weve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July. Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe CDCissued new mask guidelines. Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free. And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives. I know some are talking about living with COVID-19. Tonight  I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. Here are four common sense ste...</td>\n",

       "0  [Lets use this moment to reset. Lets stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Lets stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans. We cant change how divided weve been. But we can change how we move forwardon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans whod grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. Ive worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers wholl walk the beat, wholl know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. So lets not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Lets come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. Thats why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. Thats why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruptiontrusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope. We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe. And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at homethey have no serial numbers and cant be traced. And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that cant be sued. These laws dont infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote  and to have it counted. And its under assault. In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. We cannot let this happen. Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while youre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, Id like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nations top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyers legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since shes been nominated, shes received a broad range of supportfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, weve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. Weve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. Were putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. Were securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this landmy forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families dont wait decades to reunite. Its not only the right thing to doits the economically smart thing to do. Thats why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce., The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition. Im a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isnt capitalism. Its exploitationand it drives up prices. When corporations dont have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. Tonight, Im announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. Well also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. Lets pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Lets increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jillour First Lady who teaches full-timecalls Americas best-kept secret: community colleges. And lets pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a unionthey shouldnt be stopped. When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we havent done in a long time: build a better America. For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. And I know youre tired, frustrated, and exhausted. But I also know this. Because of the progress weve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. Weve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July. Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe CDCissued new mask guidelines. Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free. And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives. I know some are talking about living with COVID-19. Tonight  I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. Here are four common sense ste...   \n",
